**The idea of the project:**

This repository is a personal project from my experience in the sector.

I started with a free template and then I embroider around it.

The site aims to offer a showcase site for a company in the sector but also to be able to allow a client, an employee of the company to consult the work in progress and the analyzes related to it. Employees will also have this opportunity.
Back side, the administrators will be able to add, consult the building sites and the information relating to it, idem for the analyzes, users of the site, both workers and customer. Ultimately, the idea would be to retrieve the analysis results and fill them in automatically.
The other idea related to the sites would be to monitor the state of stocks, materials, their monitoring, their history.

**Technical**

Based on Symfony 5, MySql, JQuery, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Doctrine
